Face mask detector for people. Created during quarantine caused by COVID19. That is my first Python and Machine Learning project and I did not develop all the source code, check the "How it was developed?" section of this README file. 

## Development setup ‚öíÔ∏è

First of all you should need Python3 installed (and pip), to install python3 check the official website of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After that, you need install project dependencies using CLI (Command Line Interface) running this line of code on root folder:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How it was developed? ü§ñ

This project was developed by **Nelson Kenmochi** and it is a modification of another similar project, I tried to improve it in certain aspects. Check the another Github project link below üëá
